PROJECT OVERVIEW:
1. It looks to see how much pink is in the fields of the flowers.
2. It will detect the amount of pink and make it into a percent for the person using the program to see.
3. It will just look for how much pink is in each picture and print.

TESTING AND ROBUSTNESS:
I tested to see if the percentages were acurate. They weren't acurate so I adjusted the tolerance. When I implimented 
new code, I would make it print out to see if it would print out what I wanted and expected.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
The code was already omptimized to be less than 1 second. The part of the program that takes the longest is checking pink7.webp 
because it has to do more tasks than the others as it has to add more pink pixels to the tally.

CHALLENGES FACED:
One of the most major challenge I had to overcome for this project was adjusting the tolerance for pink detection.
At first, it would output some pictures with 1.6% etc, but after I kept on fine tuning it, it eventually came to be
what it is now. One of the most important parts of fine tuning this was finding the in between part of the r, g, b.

REAL WORLD USE-CASE:
Some people collect plants for collective purposes and pink flowers are very unusual to find in the wild. So, if someone 
is looking for a rare pink flower, they can plug it into this and check which ones could have the flowers.
