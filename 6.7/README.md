PROJECT OVERVIEW:
1. It looks to see how much pink is in the fields of the flowers.
2. It will detect the amount of pink and make it into a percent for the person using the program to see.
3. It will just look for how much pink is in each picture and print.

TESTING AND ROBUSTNESS:


PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
