1. I will be scanning flowers for my main theme.
2. My code will be detecting if the flowers are pink.
3. There will be a function that goes through all of the pixels to look if there is pink. Pink
is usually not found in nature besides flowers, so if it detects pink, it will most likely be
a flower.
