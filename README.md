Main Project:
    Approach:
        I wanted to make a program that would present options for you to choose from and for it to print onto the screen. I wanted atleast 1 to be customizable.
    Explanation:
        Program lets user choose between drawing a pumpkin, snowflake or tree. If tree is chosen it lets user choose the amount of branches.

    Peer evaluation:
        Pretty good except limited freedom when making pumpkin and snowflake, if leland added editable levels for the snowflake and make the pumpkin bigger or smaller, it would be better.
